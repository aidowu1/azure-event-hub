Steps to create my Github authentication needs using ssh key
------------------------------------------------------------

Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

Steps:

1) Open Git Bash.

2) Generate the privte/public ssh keys:
    - ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -C "adeidowu@hotmail.com"
        - This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label
        - The output of this step include:
            - > Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair.
            - > Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]

3) At the prompt, type a secure passphrase:
    - The output of this step include:
        - > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
        - > Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

4) Add the private ssh key to your laptop ssh-agent:In a terminal window without elevated permissions, add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file, usin the following step:
    - On windows OS:
        - ssh-add C:\Users\YOU/.ssh/id_rsa
    - Or on Ubuntu Linux OS:
        - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        - ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

5) Add the SSH public key to your account on GitHub:
    - In order to get our key, use the following command:
        - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    - Then copy the key content (starting from ssh-rsa)
    - In your Github instance, click on your profile in the top right corner and select "Settings" from the drop-down box.
    - Now from the Account Settings section present on the left, select "SSH and GPG keys"
    - To add a new key, Click on New SSH key
    - Under the title section, add a name to your key. Then in the key section, paste the key that we copied from our terminal. Finally, click on Add SSH key

7) Notes on git push of changes to a remote repo. The steps include:
    - Create the remote repo in Git:
        - Follow the instructions described here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository
    - On the local pc/laptop push the changes in the local repo after the local commit with these steps:
        - git push origin main
            - You might get a response such as:
                - fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/aidowu1/azure-event-hub.git/': gnutls_handshake() failed: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated.
            - To fix this, please invoke the following:
                - git config --global http.sslVerify false
